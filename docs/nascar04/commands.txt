=== CRITICAL NOTES ===
• NO "AUTH_STATE" field in client binary
• Authentication completes via: auth → automatic pers → internal state machine
• BLOC command handler not found in binary (likely server-side only)
• Field parsers: TagFieldFind @ 0x31ddd0, TagFieldGetString @ 0x31ed10
• Challenge initiation uses AUXI, responses use MESG
• ROOM handler serves both 'sele' (query) and 'room' (creation)
• PERS and USER share same handler @ 0x288080
• +pop format: Z=room_id:count,room_id:count (colon separator, not slash)
• play command includes 272-byte session data (embedded, not separate +ses)
