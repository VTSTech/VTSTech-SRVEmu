FUNCTION: Lobby_SynchronizeUserList (0x00204158)
CATEGORY: Protocol / User Management

SYNOPSIS:
Processes the decoded fields of a +usr or +who packet to update the 
local LobbyContext user list and initiate P2P keepalives.

PARAMETERS:
- param_1: [out] Result State (1=Joined, 2=Updated, 3=Removed)
- param_2: [in] User ID (Converted from I= string)
- param_3-5: [in] Pointers to peer networking structures
- param_8: [in] Pointer to self-identity structure

INTERNAL LOGIC:
1. Lookup: Calls FUN_002663b8 to see if UserID exists in Hash Table 0xD4.
2. IP Formatting: Uses Util_FormatIPString to prepare the peer's IP for pings.
3. State Transition:
   - If lVar6 == 0: New User Joined -> Allocates entry.
   - If lVar6 == 1: Existing User -> Updates flags (F=).
4. P2P Mesh: Triggers Network_SendKeepalive (UDP Heartbeats) to the
   IP address provided in the A= field of the packet.
5. Slot Management: Loops through the room's 5-player slots to ensure 
   the UI user-list stays synchronized with the network state.

CRITICAL DISCOVERY:
The function uses 32-bit floats (fVar14-17) to track the 'Last Ping' 
time for each user. If the server stops sending +usr updates, these 
timers expire, and the client will eventually call FUN_002044e8 (Remove User).
