# Reborn. Revived. Project is alive again. Nov 2025

New R10 Modular codebase.

Currently has game specific modules for Nascar Thunder 2004 and NBA Street V3. More to come soon.

Other games will likely 'just work' for connection, authentication and persona management.
(Assuming Encryption and DNAS bypassed)
