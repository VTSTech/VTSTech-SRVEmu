VTSTech-SRVEmu was an ambitious project to be a multi-game server emulator for games utilizing a protocol used in many EA games.

The login, authentication and persona management is more or less complete. But the rest of the server/game does not function in any title.

I'm discontinuing this project becasuse I believe it is beyond my ability to complete this implementation or achieve any of the original goals of this project.
